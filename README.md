#Inspiration
After learning about ShipHawk's robust API, we were inspired to make a mobile application that uses this API. Instead of having to use a computer, users can use an easy, convenient mobile app.

#What it does
Our app lets users take a picture of the item they want to ship, enter the shipping zip codes, and receive shipping rates.

#How we built it
We built this using Xcode, Swift, and Adobe Illustrator. We used the Shiphawk and Clarifai API's.

#Challenges we ran into
Some of the many challenges we ran into were updating Xcode, learning API calls, and learning iOS development.

#Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of how well designed our app is and that all of our intended features work.

#What we learned
We learned iOS development, working with API's, Artificial Intelligence, teamwork, among many other things.

#What's next for Just Ship It
We hope to continue development on our app to fine tune it into an actual production ready application.
